A multi-launcher for different launchers, allowing for maximum convenience!

# Usage

A compiled version is not currently available, however if you know how to compile Electron then you can do that.

# Customization

By default, there are six major game launchers built in; albeit without the file paths:

- Steam
- Epic Games
- Uplay (Ubisoft)
- Origin
- Battle.net
- Riot Games

## How to add more

When in the app, only six launchers are shown on the header at a time, this **will** be fixed in coming updates.
